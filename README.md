# Mini-Project-2

This is the second major coding project designed to consolidate everything learned in Modules 5 - 7: Back-end Development, Node.js, APIs, React, Router, Hooks, External UI Libraries, and API integration.

## Overview

This project is designed to consolidate your knowledge of modern Front-End development using **React**. You will build a Single Page Application (SPA) that demonstrates your ability to manage component-based architecture, client-side routing, and complex state management.

The goal is to move beyond static pages and simple DOM manipulation (which you did in Mini-Project #1) and create a dynamic, responsive user experience similar to modern commercial web applications.

Your project should demonstrate clear design thinking, a solid grasp of the React lifecycle (via Hooks), and the ability to integrate external UI libraries.

## Project Goals

Your web app should:

* Be built entirely using **React Functional Components**.
* Utilize **React Router** to create a multi-page experience within a single-page application.
* Demonstrate appropriate use of **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, and optionally `useContext`).
* Fetch and display data from an **external API** (or complex internal data structure).
* Integrate a **React UI Library** (e.g., Material UI, React Bootstrap, Chakra UI) for styling and components.
* Break down the UI into small, reusable **components** with clear parent/child relationships.
* Be version-controlled using **Git** with meaningful commits and branches.
* Be clearly explained during a **5–10 minute presentation**.

## Presentation Goals

During your presentation, please address the following specific points:

1.  **Process:** What was your requirements gathering and design process? (Show your wireframes/Figma).
2.  **Overview:** Give a high-level overview of your application and its features.
3.  **Data:** Where does your data come from? How does the application process and display it?
4.  **Interaction:** How does the user interact with your application?
5.  **Architecture:**
    * How did you structure/break up your components?
6.  **Hooks:** What kinds of React hooks have you used (e.g., state, context, effect, navigate) and how?
7.  **Tools:** What external tools or libraries have you used (e.g., Axios, MUI)? Why did you choose them?
8.  **Future:** How might you extend the features of your application in the future?

## Minimum Viable Project (MVP)

Your project must include:

- [ ] A **design plan** (wireframe, sketch, or Figma link)
- [ ] A functional **React application** (created via Vite)
- [ ] At least **three distinct routes** (pages) navigable via React Router
- [ ] Proper usage of `useState` to manage application data
- [ ] Proper usage of `useEffect` to handle side effects (like API calls)
- [ ] Integration of a **UI Component Library** (MUI, Bootstrap, etc.)
- [ ] **Fetched data** displayed dynamically on the UI
- [ ] Proper **Git version control** (meaningful commits, repository hosted on GitHub)
- [ ] Minimum 2 Branches, merged into **main** via **Pull Requests**
- [ ] A **5–10 minute presentation** explaining your app, process, and code

## Optional Enhancements (Stretch Goals)

Not required, but these can elevate your project and score:

- **Global State Management:** Use `useContext` to avoid "prop-drilling" across multiple levels.
- **Custom Hooks:** Extract repetitive logic into your own custom hooks.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Use URL parameters (e.g., `/product/:id`) to render detailed views for specific items.
- **Form Handling:** Complex form validation or controlled components.
- **Deployment:** Host your app live on Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## Rubric

The project is graded out of **10 points** based on the following criteria:

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Design & Planning** | Evidence of requirements gathering, wireframes (Figma/Sketches), and component hierarchy planning prior to coding. |
| **Functionality** | The application runs without errors, navigation works correctly, and the app meets the objectives defined in your scope. |
| **Code Quality** | Code is tidy, logical, and well-structured. avoids repetition (DRY), and components are small and focused. |
| **React Concepts** | Correct implementation of Functional Components, Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and Routing. |
| **UI/UX** | Application is visually attractive, responsive, and makes good use of the chosen UI library. |
| **Presentation** | Engaging 5–10 minute delivery that clearly answers the presentation questions listed above. |

| Score | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10 points | Fully functional, original application that meets all objectives, uses well structured code and includes evidence of design/requirements planning |
| 8–9 points | Mostly functional application covering main objectives, with tidy code and evidence of planning |
| 7 points | Minimal planning/design, application includes core features with some attempts at well structured code |
| 6 points or below | Reliance on code copied from elsewhere, important features incomplete, mostly messy/unstructured code, no design process |

## Tips for Success

* **Think in React:** Before coding, draw a box around every component in your design. Decide what is a parent, what is a child, and where the "State" should live.
* **Don't Over-complicate:** A simple, working app is better than a complex, broken one. Aim for 8–10 hours of effort.
* **Console is your Friend:** Keep your browser developer tools (and React Dev Tools extension) open to watch for errors and log your data flow.
* **Read the Docs:** React and Material UI/Bootstrap have excellent documentation. Refer to them often.
